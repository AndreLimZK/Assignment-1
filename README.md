Andre Lim's Assignment One

# One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.
I have been designing a website for Snow Patrol, an alternative rock band with a rather soothing and engaging set of music as well as stage acts. The page has a rather straightforward layout in accordance with the band’s preferences, which includes striking gold details on a darker canvas. Most pages come with a distinctive welcoming message along with a well-designed header, enabling users to access various sections easily, including the ‘musics’ and the ‘shows’ pages. Every page is designed for a purpose, on a particular subject matter or theme that allows the fans to view pictures or links of the band on social networks.

The ‘Shows’ page presents an elegant, coherent structure, all concert dates and the places where people are going to perform are listed there and have pictures. Guided by responsive design principles, we made the site usable and aesthetically pleasing on any device, be it a computer or the mobile phone. Users are literally one click away from purchasing a desired ticket, thanks to the numerous interactive features including the buttons that are designed to open a new tab to enable users buy tickets for shows. Methinks, contemporary typefaces such as Oswald make the overall aesthetics of modernism, on the other hand, the unique selling proposition and the desired messages are not very wordy.

# Design Process
The website was designed with the intention of keeping the band's new album in mind not only as a form of promotion but also to represent the new direction that they decided to take their music. 

here is the figma link of the wireframe i used, https://www.figma.com/design/Kz4eQVVZPr0ZxLSx627LSE/ID_ASG1_Wireframes?node-id=0-1&t=O5BQ6Ewpvvb2pk8k-1

# Features
Feature 1 - allows users to fill in their email and questions using the enquiry form at the bottom of the footer to stay connected with the band using javascript
Feature 2 - ticketing page that allows the users to easily access third party websites to buy tickets to see the band perform live also through javascript

Features Left to Implement
Feature 1 - add a responsive feature where if there are no more tickets on the third party website, change the ticket button to display "sold out". 

Throughout this project, I relied heavily on the slides provided by school as well as https://www.w3schools.com for features I was unfamiliar with, specifically during the CSS portion. 

# Testing
Enquiry Form:
Scroll down to the footer at the bottom of the page
When trying to submit the empty form, an error message about the required fields being empty appears
When trying to submit the form with an invalid email address, an error message regarding the email's format appears
When trying to submit the form with all inputs valid, a success message pops up telling users that their request has been sent.

For mobile view, the website shifts itself around to fit the screen size, turning most of the content into a vertical page. 

Most bugs that I encountered were that the exact same styles.css file produced extremely different results. Only after restarting my applications did the app return to normal.

I received inspiration for this project from their current website which was rebranded to resemble the aesthetic of their latest album, "The Forest is the Path".
